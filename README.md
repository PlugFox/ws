The `ws` package provides a cross-platform WebSocket client for both Dart and Flutter applications. It allows you to connect to a WebSocket server, send and receive messages, and handle the connection state changes.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ws: ^0.1.0
```

## Properties

- `state`: A read-only property that returns the current WebSocket connection state.
- `stateChanges`: A read-only property that returns a stream of WebSocket connection state changes.
- `stream`: A read-only property that returns a stream of message events handled by the WebSocket.

## Methods

- `connect(String url)`: Connects to the WebSocket server specified by the URL argument.
- `disconnect([int? code = 1000, String? reason = 'NORMAL_CLOSURE'])`: Closes the WebSocket connection. You can optionally pass a numeric code and a reason string to the method to send close information to the remote peer.
- `add(Object data)`: Sends data on the WebSocket connection. The data can be either a String or a List of integers holding bytes.
- `close([int? code = 1000, String? reason = 'NORMAL_CLOSURE'])`: Permanently stops the WebSocket connection and frees all resources. After calling this method, the WebSocket client is no longer usable.

## Example

```dart
import 'package:ws/ws.dart';

void main() async {
  const url = 'ws://localhost:1234';

  final client = WebSocketClient.connect(url);

  client.stream.listen((message) {
    print('Received message: $message');
  });

  client.add('Hello, server!');

  await Future<void>.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 10));
  client.close();
}
```

## Reconnection

The `ws` package provides a cross-platform WebSocket client that supports automatic reconnection in case of connection loss. The client automatically tries to reconnect to the server when the connection is lost. To handle reconnection-related events, you can register listeners for the `stateChanges` stream, which notifies you about changes in the connection state. When the connection is closed, the client tries to reconnect with a delay, which increases exponentially with each unsuccessful attempt to prevent overloading the server.
